                <h3>What happens to my dataset?</h3>

                <p>
                    An acknowledgement email will be sent to you, and we will deal with the rest. Once your datasets are
                    processed by the ProteomeXchange, you will be notified with another email, it will include
                    the information for you to view the result. If you have any question about your submission, you can
                    also contact us by simply replying to the email you got from us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your dataset will be initially stored as private experiments in the PRIDE database. Once you
                    instruct us to make them public, they will be propagated to other proteomics repositories such as
                    PeptideAtlas.

                <h3>Why my submission keeps failing?</h3>

                <p>
                    There are several things you should check:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Network connection:</strong> Try using a wired connection if you're on wireless, as wireless networks can cause connection timeouts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Firewall settings:</strong> Check with your system administrator to ensure connections to external servers are allowed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transfer method:</strong> Try different transfer methods (Aspera → FTP → Globus) if one fails.</li>
                        <li><strong>Network restrictions:</strong> Some corporate networks block certain protocols - try Globus as an alternative.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="piProcedureSteps">
                <a name="java"></a>

                <h3>Java and system requirements</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Do I need to install Java separately?</strong><br/>
                    A: No! The tool automatically downloads Java 21 JRE if needed. It checks your system first and only downloads if necessary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: What if the Java download fails?</strong><br/>
                    A: You can install Java 21 manually from <a href="https://adoptium.net/">Adoptium</a>, or check your internet connection and firewall settings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Which operating systems are supported?</strong><br/>
                    A: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, and Linux. The tool is completely portable and works on all major platforms.
                </p>

            <div class="piProcedureSteps">
                <a name="launcher"></a>

                <h3>Launcher and startup issues</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: The tool won't start on macOS - what should I do?</strong><br/>
                    A: macOS security may block the launcher. Right-click <code>start.sh</code> and select "Open", or run <code>xattr -cr .</code> in Terminal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: I get permission errors on Linux/macOS</strong><br/>
                    A: Make the launcher executable by running <code>chmod +x start.sh</code> in Terminal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: The tool says "Another instance is running" but I don't see it</strong><br/>
                    A: Check for background Java processes and kill them, or restart your computer. The tool uses network-based locking.
                </p>

                <h3>File management and checksums</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: What are checksum.txt files?</strong><br/>
                    A: These are automatically generated files that ensure data integrity during upload. They're protected from removal and required for submission.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Can I remove checksum.txt files?</strong><br/>
                    A: No, these files are protected to maintain submission integrity. The tool prevents their removal and regenerates them as needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: How do I remove individual files?</strong><br/>
                    A: When files are present, a "Remove" column appears with trash icon buttons. Click the trash icon next to any file to remove it individually.
