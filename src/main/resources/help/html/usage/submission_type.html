            <a href="http://www.proteomexchange.org/">ProteomeXchange Submission Tool </a> assists you to
            submit your MS/MS datasets to multiple key proteomics data repositories, such as:
            <a href="http://wwww.ebi.ac.uk/pride">PRIDE</a> and <a href="http://www.peptideatlas.org/">PeptideAtlas</a>.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <div class="warning">
            Before starting the submission, you need to decide on which type of submission to make:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#complete">Complete submission</a></li>
                <li><a href="#partial">Partial submission</a></li>
                <li><a href="#affinity">Affinity proteomics submission</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            You can select the type of submission by clicking on the checkboxes / button highlighted below:

                <h3> Complete submission</h3>

                <p>
                    This type is highly recommended. You will be issued with not only a ProteomeXchange accession but
                    also
                    a permanent DOI number to uniquely identify your submission in the future. With additional benefits
                    that, PRIDE will show your data and allow private journal review support. Your data will also be
                    available on the ProteomeXchange FTP to download once it has been made public.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The complete submission requires the following information:
                <li><b>Result Files</b>: They are either mzIdentML or mzTab with spectrum files such as: MGF, mzML.
                </li>

                <li><b>Raw Files</b>: MS instrument outputs, such as: BRUKER .baf files. If your raw outputs are
                    directories instead of files, please compress them into individual files before upload.
                </li>

                <li><b>PRIDE Login</b>: PRIDE user name and password. All submissions to the ProteomeXchange are
                    private by default, the user name and password will help us to secure your submissions.
                    You can register a new user account at <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/register">PRIDE</a>
                </li>

                <li><b>Experiment Details</b>: Details about the setup and context of your experiment (e.g., sample details, protocols, species, tissues)</li>

                <li><b>Lab Head</b>: The affiliation of the lab head (e.g., name, email, and address)</li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although not required, we would also recommend you to submit the following data files:
                <li><b>Search result files</b>: the original output from your search engine or your analysis
                    pipeline, such as: Mascot .dat files. They should contain the peptide/protein identifications.
                </li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="piProcedureSteps">
                <a name="partial"/>

                <h3>Partial submission</h3>

                <p>
                    This type is not recommended, since it will significantly reduce the visibility and reusability of
                    your dataset. You should only choose this option if your identification results cannot be generated to the
                    mzIdentML or mzTab format. Consequently, you will be only issued with a ProteomeXchange accession,
                    and your dataset will only be available on the ProteomeXchange FTP to download.
                </p>

                <h3>Affinity proteomics submission</h3>

                <p>
                    This submission type is specifically designed for affinity proteomics datasets. Affinity proteomics 
                    experiments involve the targeted quantification of proteins in a biological sample using specific 
                    binding interactions between molecules, such as antibodies and antigens (e.g., SomaScan or Olink experiments).
                </p>

                <p>
                    A PAD identifier will be provided to uniquely identify the dataset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The affinity proteomics submission requires the following information:
                <li><b>Protein Quantification Files</b>: Files containing protein quantification data from affinity proteomics experiments.</li>
                <li><b>Raw Data Files (Recommended)</b>: Raw instrument outputs, if available.</li>
                <li><b>PRIDE Login</b>: PRIDE user name and password for secure submission.</li>
                <li><b>Experiment Details</b>: Details about the affinity proteomics experimental setup and context.</li>
                <li><b>Lab Head</b>: The affiliation of the lab head (e.g., name, email, and address).</li>
                </p>

                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> This submission type is specifically tailored for affinity proteomics workflows 
                    and may have different file type requirements compared to standard proteomics submissions.
