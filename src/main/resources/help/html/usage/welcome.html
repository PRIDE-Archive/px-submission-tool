            <a href="http://www.proteomexchange.org/">ProteomeXchange Submission Tool </a> assists you to
            submit your MS/MS datasets to multiple key proteomics data repositories, such as:
            <a href="http://wwww.ebi.ac.uk/pride">PRIDE</a> and <a href="http://www.peptideatlas.org/">PeptideAtlas</a>.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <div class="warning">
            Before start the submission, you need to decide on which type of submission to make:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#complete">Complete submission</a></li>
                <li><a href="#partial">Partial submission</a></li>
                <li><a href="#bulk">Bulk submission</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            You can select the type of submission by clicking on the checkboxes / button highlighted below:

    <div id="content">

            <div class="piProcedureSteps">
                <a name="complete"/>

                <h3> Complete submission</h3>

                <p>
                    This type is highly recommended. You will be issued with not only a ProteomeXchange accession but
                    also
                    a permanent DOI number to uniquely identify your submission in the future. With additional benefits
                    that, PRIDE will show your data and allow private journal review support. Your data will also be
                    available on the ProteomeXchange FTP to download once it has been made public.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The complete submission requires three sets of information:
                <li><b>Result Files</b>they are either mzIdentML or mzTab with spectrum files such as: MGF, mzML.
                </li>

                <li><b>Raw Files</b>: MS instrument outputs, such as: BRUKER .baf files. If your raw outputs are
                    directories instead of files, please compress them into individual files before upload.
                </li>

                <li><b>PRIDE Login</b>: PRIDE user name and password. All submissions to the ProteomeXchange are
                    private by default, the user name and password will help us to secure your submissions.
                    You can register a new user account at <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/register">PRIDE</a>
                </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although not required, we would also recommend you to submit the following data files:
                <li><b>Search result files</b>: the original output from your search engine or your analysis
                    pipeline, such as: Mascot .dat files. They should contain the peptide/protein identifications.
                </li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="piProcedureSteps">
                <a name="partial"/>

                <h3>Partial submission</h3>

                <p>
                    This type is not recommended, since it will significantly reduce the visibility and reusability of
                    your dataset. You should only choose this option if your identification results cannot be generated to the
                    mzIdentML or mzTab format. Consequently, you will be only issued with a ProteomeXchange accession,
                    and your dataset will only be available on the ProteomeXchange FTP to download.
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><b>Search result files</b>: the original output from your search engine or your analysis
                    pipeline, such as: Mascot .dat files. They should contain the peptide/protein identifications.
                </li>
                <li><b>Raw Files</b>: MS instrument outputs, such as: BRUKER .baf files. If your raw outputs are
                    directories instead of files, please compress them into individual files before upload.
                </li>

                <li><b>PRIDE Login</b>: PRIDE user name and password. All submissions to the ProteomeXchange are
                    private by default, the user name and password will help us to secure your submissions.

            </div>

            <div class="piProcedureSteps">
                <a name="bulk"/>

                <h3>Bulk submission</h3>

                <p>
                    Bulk submission is mainly for submissions that contain a large set of data files,
                    for example, more than 200 files. It helps to avoid manually assigning all the required information.
                    Both complete submissions and partial submissions can be made used through option.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The bulk submission requires three set of information:
                <li><b>Experiment data files</b>: The files you want to submit to the ProteomeXchange, such as: raw
                    instrument outputs, search engine outputs.
                </li>
                <li><b>Submission summary file</b>: This file captures the descriptive information about a
                    ProteomeXchange submission, such as: experimental metadata, file relations, and etc. For the
                    details,
                    please refer to the <a href="http://www.proteomexchange.org/bulk-submission">file format</a>.
                </li>
