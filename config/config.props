# Training mode configuration
#
# When working with the tool in 'training mode', the user is able to go through the whole submission process as usual but,
# at the end of the process, no actual submission will be done, this means the files will not be uploaded and the submission
# will not be registered.
# Also, providing feedback will not be required, so the user is allowed to omit it and either close the application or
# start another submission.
#
# (status is 'on' or 'off')
training.mode.status = off


#   To set number of threads parallely calculate checksum for files that are to be submitted
