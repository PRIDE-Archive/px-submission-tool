                    An acknowledgement email will be sent to you, and we will deal with the rest. Once your datasets are
                    processed by the ProteomeXchange, you will be notified with another email, it will include
                    the information for you to view the result. If you have any question about your submission, you can
                    also contact us by simply replying to the email you got from us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your dataset will be initially stored as private experiments in the PRIDE database. Once you
                    instruct us to make them public, they will be propagated to other proteomics repositories such as
                    PeptideAtlas.

                    There are two things you should check:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wireless network: try to use a wired connection if you using a wireless network, wireless networks is one of main reasons to have connection timeout.</li>
                        <li>Firewall settings: check your local firewall settings with your system administrator, make sure that connections to external ftp servers are allowed.</li>
                    </ul>
